## Synopsis

PyVirb is a program and library for talking to Garmin VIRB cameras.
The goal is to have two layers - one for finding cameras, and another
for connecting to individual cameras identified on a network.

## Code Example

## Motivation

Garmin published the VIRB API, but I haven't seen any projects to use it.
