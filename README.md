## Synopsis

PyVirb is a program and library for talking to Garmin VIRB cameras
over WiFi. The goal is to have two layers - one for finding cameras,
and another for connecting to individual cameras identified on a network.

## Code Example

TODO.

## Motivation

Garmin published the VIRB API, but I haven't seen any python libraries
that use it yet.

## Installation

TODO: add setup.py support

## API Reference

VirbLister - use this to identify VIRBs over mDNS

Virb - use this to talk to a VIRB

## Tests

You can excercise everything with console.py.
TODO: Add automated tests.
