## Synopsis

PyVirb is a program and library for talking to Garmin VIRB cameras
over WiFi. The goal is to have two layers - one for finding cameras,
and another for connecting to individual cameras identified on a network.

## Code Example

TODO.

## Motivation

Garmin published the VIRB API, but I haven't seen any python libraries
that use it yet.

## Installation
